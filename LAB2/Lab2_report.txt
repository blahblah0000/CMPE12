#####################################Lynne DiepLab Section 1: T/Thurs @ 2PMDue: October 9, 2016Lab Partner: None#####################################Title:Lab 2: Adding and SubtractingPurpose:Learn how to use combinational and sequential logic to add and subtract a sequence of numbers together.Procedure:There is a diagram included within the lab instructions and the goal is to design a schematic that follows the diagram and to successfully add and subtract a sequence of numbers together. Part 1 involved designing the register, which was 6 bits wide; by combining 6 D flip flops for storage. Additionally the use of switches allowed for clearing, toggle, and clock. Part 2 involved the keypad as the input for out sequence of numbers. Part 3 was creating the adder schematic; the lab recommended creating a full bit adder and copying it 6 times for a 6-bit adder. Connecting the adders involved using the Cin and Cout inputs and outputs. Part 4 was to create a subtraction schematic, or inverting and adding 1. Using a NOR gate allowed for the sequence of numbers to be inverted and using MUX granted the user to switch from inverting numbers or not. With still following the diagram included in the lab, connecting the display was the final step, and testing the schematic until the results were correct concluded Lab 2.Algorithms and other data:The clear must be connected to an inverter or else the output will continue to be 0, and will not work properly as it should. Additionally the user must press the clear button for the schematic to register the users’ inputs.What went wrong or what were the challenges:Going over the lab instructions and trying to figure out what exactly was needed to be done for each step was confusing. Thankfully, I had helpful classmates and TAs that were able to explain the directions more clearly, and I had a better concept of the lab. Additionally, my display was not working correctly when finished with my schematic. I went over my design thoroughly and eventually found the bug, and corrected the display.Other Information:Discuss issues you had building the circuit. Describe what you added to the minimum specifications to make debugging easier.An issue I had with building the circuit was figuring out how to design the adder schematic correctly. In order to make debugging easier, I used LEDs that were linked up to each of my 1-bit adders and tested them thoroughly. Whichever number I input to the keypad, the LEDs would light up according to its 4 bit binary number.What happens when you subtract a larger number from a smaller number? Does the result make sense? Your 7-segment display might not. What happens when you add 2 numbers that won’t fit 6 bits? You will need to add several times to do this as you only have 4-bit input.The display shows the incorrect answer, so the result does not make sense. Additionally when adding 2 numbers that won’t fit 6-bits, 2 numbers appear on the display that are not relevant to the numbers the user input.Conclusion:The lab was difficult to understand, but with the help of TAs and classmates, I was able to understand how to use combinational and sequential logic to add and subtract a sequence of numbers together.Extra:The lab can be improved by stating clearer instructions.
