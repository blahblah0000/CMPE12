Being clear with your register usage is very important, also, having a clear plan for your program is essential, thus for all programs in this class you will be required to create flowcharts.Procedure:The first part of the program was the figure out how to obtain the users’ input. However, LC-3 language only allowed the user to input one character at a time, so I had to loop GETC multiple times until the user pressed “enter”. Each time the user would input a character, that character would store the following digit into ASCII memory. Additionally, every input entered would increase the loop counter by one. The counter is used to tell the machine whether a specific digit is in the ten thousandths, thousandths, hundreds, tens or ones. After this initial part, I had to convert the users’ decimal input to binary. With the loop counter, a specific digit will be multiplied by ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten or one. For example if the loop counter states 4 and the 4th place digit is 3, then the code would multiply 3 by 1000 because it is the in the thousands place. After each of the users’ input digit is converted, the machine adds them all together. Converting the summed ASCII number into binary involved using the MASK method and AND the sum number with each MASK. This would result in a string of 1’s and 0’s. If the users’ input was negative, then converting the ASCII number would involve NOTing it and then adding one because of 2’s complement.Algorithms and other data:Since LC-3 does not have a multiply function, I basically had to break down multiplication in terms of addition (ADD). Although tedious, the results proved that addition fully completes the goal of multiplication. Additionally using and understanding the MASK method definitely helped me complete this lab. Without these methods and data, completing the lab would be a difficulty. What went wrong or what were the challenges:At the beginning of the lab, one of the main challenges for me was to loop GETC until the user pressed “enter”. Assembly language is a difficult language to write and understand so this lab took more time and consideration than past labs. Additionally, being that Lab 3 is the first lab in LC-3, understanding the appropriate syntax was a challenge. Other Information:Discuss algorithm(s) you implemented and issues doing so. Discuss any particular constructs in assembly you made that made the problem easier to solve. Be sure to include how you used your flowchart in the actually coding of your program.The flowchart was basically the outline of the program; I treated it as a step-by-step process. For example, first I need to clear my registers, then I need to ask the users for their inputs, and so on. It made it more clearly for me to center my thoughts on different aspects of the program. Additionally understanding and using the MASK methods definitely helped me in solving the problem. Knowing that adding the ASCII numbers and ANDing the sum number with each MASK converts the number into a string of 1’s and 0’s allowed me to get a better understanding of the lab.Conclusion:The lab was a great introduction to LC-3 and I appreciate the 2 weeks that were given to work on it. I understand the importance of have a clear plan and the use of the flowchart significantly made programming this lab simpler. Extra:The TAs and tutors provided excellence guidance for this lab, and I appreciate their help!
